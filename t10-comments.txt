Great job, only a few minor issues:

Usage:

1. When you display the list when displaying products, it would be nice
to see how many are in stock and what is being sold. Ideally, the same
information as they would see from option #1 from the 1st level.

Code:

1. In CashReader, make sure you do something within the catch - 

---------------------------------------------------
        try {
            File outputFile = new File("log.txt");
	.....

        } catch (Exception e) {

        }
---------------------------------------------------

A simple sysout would do. The reason we are catching things is to notify
someone that some unusual thing happened, in this case it would be that
the machine couldn't open log.txt.
